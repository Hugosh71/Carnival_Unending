--------
Game submission for the narrative driven jam #12 2023

<i>
You are a tourist, visiting Venice during the Carnevale. 

The Carnevale is a celebration that happens before Lent and culminates in Martedi Grasso (Mardi Gras/Fat Tuesday). 
While trying to have a normal vacation, you find yourself at the center of a love story... or a comedy... or a tragedy... you can't quite tell to be honest.
